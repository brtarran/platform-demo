So, this is the big moment. Can I use GitHub Actions to update the website without having to run anything myself. If I can, I'll be super happy.

## But what if...

What if I can't? Well, I'll just have to try something else.

## Will you be disappointed?

Yes, but it's all trial and error. I'm sure I'll get it working eventually.

## Conclusion

Fingers crossed!
